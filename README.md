# **Intuit Case Study**

*For the purposes of this case study I focused on Intuit, Inc., specifically its tax preparation product and services.*

## **Origin Story of Intuit, Inc.**
Intuit, Inc. is a financial technology company whose mission is to power prosperity in communities around the world.  Intuit utilizes its people and resources to create economic opportunities and financial literacy for individuals, small businesses, and self-employed individuals.

Before Intuit was developed, Scott Cook had an idea to offer a basic bookkeeping software to help people pay their bills while capitalizing on the newly trending use of personal computers.  Scott Cook had a background in marketing and product development, but he needed a programmer.  He met Tom Proulx who was a programmer.  The two men sought funding from venture capitals to develop and mass produce their idea, but no venture capital would invest.  The company was funded with money that was borrowed from relatives.  Scott Cook’s father loaned him money from his retirement funds.  Scott Cook and Tom Proulx started Intuit in 1983 in Palo Alto, CA.  Scott Cook currently serves as the Chairman of the Executive Committee.

Intuit’s first product, Quicken, was developed in 1984, which was coded by Tom Proulx in Microsoft's BASIC programming language for the IBM PC and UCSD Pascal for the Apple II.  The company was able to launch its software by word of mouth.  Other competitors at the time were Visicalc, a personal spreadsheet software that was also offered for personal computers and released for Apple II.

According to Wikipedia, TurboTax was developed in 1984 by Michael Chipman of Chipsoft, a tax-preparation software company.  A Mac version of the product was  developed by SoftView and named MacinTax.  SoftView was purchased by Chipsoft.  In 1993, Intuit acquired Chipsoft and reached a market capitalization of $2 billion as it was also incorporated and went public during the same period.  Today, Intuit operates in the US, Canada, and UK.

## **Business Activities**
In alignment with Intuit’s mission, the company is working to bring financial prosperity to its customers.  One example of Intuit working to bring financial prosperity to its customers is through its TurboTax product.  The company is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning to put more money in the pocket of its customers while boosting customers’ confidence to file their own returns.  Intuit wants to use AI to empower its customers to be more financially literate.  According to the Intuit Blog, “U.S. income tax is one of the most complicated compliance systems in the world.” There are thousands of pages of tax code and hundreds of federal tax forms.  According to the Tax Foundation, “It is estimated that Americans spend 8.9 billion hours every year doing their taxes.”

Intuit merged AI and Machine Learning to introduce its Tax Knowledge Engine designed to capture tax domain expert knowledge for a personalized tax preparation experience for its customers.  The Tax Knowledge Engine allows the customer to have personalized access to U.S. tax requirements,  instructions, and calculations to build the customer’s confidence and improve the user experience of its TurboTax product.  A key feature of the engine is called “ExplainWhy” that provides a detailed drill-down of the customer question to offer further explanation.  In addition to the Tax Knowledge Engine, Intuit also offers other technologies to improve the users experience for filing their taxes such as SnapTax Mobile App and SmartLook.  The SnapTax Mobile App allows users to take photos of their W-2 forms with their smartphones and upload the data directly into TurboTax to completely prepare and e-file federal and state returns using their smartphone.  SmartLook is a one-way video technology that allows the customer to see and speak directly with a tax expert for assistance with their tax return.  SmartLook allows the tax expert to view the customers’ online return as they are actively working on it to provide product and tax-related guidance.

Intuit is employing AI to eliminate data entry from financial documents and using machine learning to capture financial domain knowledge.  The company also uses technology to collect feedback from its customers.  It employed the use of emoticons in its customer interface to collect feedback from the customers while actively using the product.  Customers can place a smiley face next to sections they enjoy using and sad faces next to items requiring more development.  

Intuit’s TurboTax product primarily targets individuals and the self-employed who file their own tax returns.  The competitors for Intuit's TurboTax product are H&R Block, TaxAct, TaxSlayer, FreeTax USA, and Jackson Hewitt.  TurboTax is a user-friendly software that can be completed on the desktop, online, and mobile app.  TurboTax has also partnered with various employers and companies to provide a seamless import of the customers W-2 and trading transactions data directly into the customers’ return.

In it's efforts to become an AI-driven platform, Intuit announced in June 2020 that it will restructure its workforce by laying off 715 positions and re-hiring 700 or more new roles that will allow the company to align its strategic efforts to invest in making the company a more customer-focused, design-driven company.

As Intuit focuses efforts on new technologies it is reported to have improved in it market share as a result.  According to an article in Accounting Today, Moody’s report that “the respective market share of the two leading tax-preparation companies, Intuit and H&R Block, remained remarkably stable during the 2019 tax season with TurboTax at a 30 percent share of electronic filings, a slight uptick from 29 percent in 2018, H&R Block's total share of electronic filings remained relatively flat at 16 percent”.

According to Intuit’s Q4 report for 2020, TurboTax customer base increased 11 percent with 22 million registered users (up from 14 million in the previous year).

The company is seeing a return on its investment in new technologies.

## **Landscape**
Intuit is a software developer for consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed.  Specifically, Intuit’s TurboTax software product targets individual consumers and the self-employed.  Intuit falls under the enterprise software/solutions domain for its products. Intuit uses technology by way of AI and machine learning to improve the financial prosperity of its customers lives through its software products and smartphone application.  Other companies that operate under the enterprise software/solutions domain that offer a tax product focused primarily on businesses include Oracle, SAP, Sage, Xero, Vertex, Avalara, and Automatic Data Processing.  The companies under the enterprise software/solutions domain that focus on individual consumers include TaxAct, TaxSlayer, FreeTax USA, Jackson Hewitt, and Intuit’s biggest competitor H&R Block. Intuit recently acquired one of its competitors, Credit Karma.

The landscape for taxes has been rapidly evolving and causing major disruptions to traditional tax functions.  With the introduction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in 2009, the traditional tax functions have been becoming more digitized resulting in changes to tax laws and regulations.  The biggest tax overhaul came in 2017 from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective 2018 - 2025, creating a major need to help consumers and businesses interpret the new tax laws and regulations.  In 2017, Ernst & Young (E&Y) launched a Tax Technology and Transformation team and its customized EYTax.Tech suite of services to assist organizations with navigating new technology requirements for tax transparency, compliance, and filing processes.  Intuit along with other companies such as E&Y are addressing these changes using AI and machine learning.

## **Results**
One of the core metrics Intuit uses to measure its success is ease of use for its products.  This is also a metric that is measured at H&R Block and used to compare the two companies' tax products. Intuit found through its research that while its product is easy to use the customer did not find “delight” in using the product.  Intuit asked its employees to identify innovative applications they use and the listed included Facebook, Google, and Apple.  Intuit used this list to redesign the company.  As Intuit is shifting its focus on new technologies it is also focusing on increasing its market share using its design to make more meaningful connections with customers.  Intuit's motto is to “Delight, don’t dilute.”  The company shared that it’s strategy to delight customers helped to gain more than 60% of the market share compared to its “next-largest” competitor at only 18%.  

Intuit is building a meaningful connection to its customer through the Tax Knowledge Engine feature “ExplainWhy” as it provides a personalized approach to help the customer file their taxes with high confidence and minimal effort.  Intuit shared that its survey received a 77% “Helpful” rating after the first year of deploying the ExplainWhy feature of the Tax Knowledge Engine and a reduction in customer calls by 46%.  Intuit believes its Tax Knowledge Engine has contributed significantly to its tax preparation software market growth.  According to an article on CNBC, Intuit’s stock gains in 2019 increased 36% compared to two of its competitors, H&R Block whose stock went down 5% and Automated Data Processing whose stock was up 22%.

## **Recommendations**
Intuit offers one of the top-rated tax preparation software products and services focused on individuals and the  self-employed consumer.  Both Intuit and H&R Block offer its customers one-on-one live review of the tax return with the option of having the tax expert e-sign and e-file the return on behalf of the customer.  Intuit’s TurboTax product is designed for the customer to file on their own and Intuit has put numerous features in place to support the customers’ confidence in filing their return on their own.  An added feature that Intuit may be offering and would be a great addition to its current TurboTax product and services is full tax preparation that allows for the tax expert to complete the customers tax return from data entry to e-filing.  With the upcoming tax season and given today’s climate, many customers may choose to forgo a visit to the traditional accountant’s office for tax services and may consider an online tax service that provides the option to upload all tax documents and have a tax expert complete and file the return on the customers’ behalf.  

In addition to the AI and machine learning that Intuit has utilized for its TurboTax customers such as SnapTax Mobile App, SmartLook, and Tax Knowledge Engine, Intuit has also explored various other technologies for its products and services.  These technologies include Open Source that allows for a community of developers to provide input for solving problems; Chat Bots that use natural language processing to listen to the customers’ questions or phrases, determine their intent, and provide a response; Intuit Aid Assist designed more recently to assist small businesses and the self-employed individuals navigate government aid and relief; Kotlin Coroutines programming used for different applications including mobile.  With these technologies already being explored and implemented the company is well-positioned to expand its service offerings and/or product line when and if needed.
